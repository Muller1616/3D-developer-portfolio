<h1>About  Portfolio</h1>
This portfolio is a reflection of my journey as a software engineer. I wanted to create a space that not only highlights my skills but also gives you a glimpse of who I am as a developer. The goal was to make it interactive, visually appealing, and mobile-friendly—so it’s easy to navigate on any device.
